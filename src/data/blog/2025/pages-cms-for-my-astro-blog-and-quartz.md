## 1. Get the repos ready

I keep two git projects side by side: `astro-blog` for the main site and `private-quartz` for the evergreen notes. Pages CMS reads files straight from the repository, so all I need locally is the repo on disk and a `.pages.yml` file in the root. I commit the config once and let Pages CMS generate commits when I publish content.

## 2. Configure media buckets for the Astro blog

Pages CMS needs to know where to drop uploads. In the Astro project I created two media entries: one for post-specific screenshots and one for shared assets. They map back into the `public` directory so Astro can serve the files without extra glue.

```yaml
media:
  - name: uploads
    label: Post assets
    input: public/images/uploads
    output: /images/uploads
    categories: [image, document]
  - name: site-assets
    label: Site assets
    input: public/assets
    output: /assets
    categories: [image, code, document]
````

The `input` value tells Pages CMS which folder in the repo should hold the raw file. The `output` value is the public URL that the Markdown editor will insert. With this mapping, when I upload a screenshot the CMS writes it to `public/images/uploads` and references it as `/images/uploads/example.png`.

## 3. Map the Astro collection

My blog posts live inside `src/data/blog`, grouped by year folders. The CMS collection reflects that layout. The `filename` pattern keeps the year folder plus a slug, which mirrors how `src/utils/getPath.ts` builds URLs at runtime. I also set the tree view to show the title, publish date, and tags so I can scan the archive quickly.

```yaml
content:
  - name: blog
    label: Blog Posts
    path: src/data/blog
    filename: "{{year}}/{{slug}}.md"
    exclude:
      - "**/_*/**"
    subfolders: true

    view:
      layout: tree
      primary: title
      fields: [ title, pubDatetime, tags ]
      sort: [ "pubDatetime desc", "title asc" ]
      search: [ title, description, tags ]
      default:
        sort: pubDatetime
        order: desc
```

The `exclude` rule hides helper folders that start with an underscore, which matches the way the Astro content loader skips drafts. Turning on `subfolders` keeps my yearly archive visible in the sidebar.

## 4. Mirror the Astro front matter schema

Every field in the CMS corresponds to a field in `src/content.config.ts`. I split the inputs into three groups so new posts always come out clean:

1. **Path helpers** for the year and slug.
2. **Required metadata** such as title, description, author, publish time, and tags.
3. **Optional toggles** like `featured`, `draft`, `ogImage`, `canonicalURL`, and `timezone`.

Hereâ€™s a shortened version of the field block:

```yaml
fields:
  - name: year
    type: select
    default: "2025"
    options:
      creatable: true
      values:
        - { label: "2024", value: "2024" }
        - { label: "2025", value: "2025" }
  - name: slug
    type: string
    pattern:
      regex: "^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$"
  - name: title
    type: string
  - name: description
    type: text
  - name: author
    type: select
    default: "Dzaki Azhari"
  - name: pubDatetime
    type: date
    options: { time: true, format: "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'" }
  - name: draft
    type: boolean
    default: false
  - name: tags
    type: select
    options:
      multiple: true
      creatable: true
  - name: ogImage
    type: image
  - name: body
    type: markdown
```

This list covers the core Astro front matter. Pages CMS writes exactly the fields that the Zod schema expects, so `pnpm run build` continues to succeed even when I add entries entirely through the browser.

## 5. Configure Quartz media and layout

My Quartz project keeps note assets inside `static/uploads`, so the Pages CMS config there defines a single media bucket that points to that folder. Because Quartz publishes the `static` directory, the CMS output path is `/uploads`. The collection uses `content` as the path, matching the folder Obsidian syncs into.

```yaml
media:
  - name: note-assets
    label: Note assets
    input: static/uploads
    output: /uploads

content:
  - name: notes
    label: Notes
    path: content
    filename: "{{slug}}.md"
    subfolders: true
```

The Quartz tree view is simpler than the Astro one because I manage thousands of notes. I keep the sidebar in list mode and rely on the folder structure to keep context. 

## 6. Mirror Quartz front matter

Quartz relies on a handful of boolean switches that control publishing, sharing, and note status. I expose them as checkboxes so the CMS writes valid YAML every time. I also keep tags and aliases as multi-select lists because Quartz uses them for backlinks and display names.

```yaml
    fields:
      - name: slug
        type: string
        pattern:
          regex: "^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$"
      - name: title
        type: string
        required: false
      - name: publish
        type: boolean
        default: false
      - name: share
        type: boolean
        default: false
      - name: draft
        type: boolean
        default: false
      - name: tags
        type: list
        of: string
      - name: aliases
        type: list
        of: string
      - name: body
        type: markdown
```

When I flip `publish` to true, the Quartz deployment workflow picks up the note during the next sync. Leaving `draft` true keeps the note local even if `publish` was ticked accidentally. 

## 7. Connect the repos to Pages CMS

Once both `.pages.yml` files are committed, I open the Pages CMS dashboard and add each repository. The flow is the same for both projects:

1. Authorize GitHub and select the repository.
2. Choose the branch (I stick with `main`).
3. Confirm the CMS sees the collection. The Astro repo shows the yearly archive tree, while the Quartz repo shows the note folders.
4. Test a dry run by creating a draft entry, filling the required fields, and saving. Pages CMS opens a pull request containing the new Markdown file.

After that, I can write from anywhere. The CMS fills the front matter for me, keeps uploads in the right folders, and never breaks the schema that the projects rely on.
