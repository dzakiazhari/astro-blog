Working in a Japanese company as part of the IT team, I’ve come across a phenomenon that seems to be ingrained in the culture of engineers, especially in Japan. It’s a phrase that’s uttered in meetings, written in teams messages, and casually dropped into conversations:

“Sorry, I lied.” (ごめん、嘘ついた)”

What’s fascinating about this expression is that it’s rarely about an actual lie. Instead, it’s a quirky, self-deprecating way to acknowledge a mistake or correct a previous statement. It’s one of those linguistic habits that you don’t notice until you start paying attention—and once you do, it’s everywhere. Let’s dive into why this happens and what it says about communication in the engineering world, particularly in Japan.

## The “Sorry, I Lied” Expression

Imagine this:

You’re in a team meeting, and a colleague confidently declares they’ve identified the cause of a system bug. Minutes later, after rechecking the logs, they realize they were wrong. Instead of saying, “I made a mistake,” they laugh and say, “Sorry, I lied. It’s actually something else.”

Or, someone promises to finish a task by the end of the week. Come Friday, they admit they underestimated the work and say, “Remember when I said I’d finish it this week? Yeah, that was a lie.”

These aren’t isolated incidents. If you’ve worked in tech in Japan, chances are you’ve heard this phrase (or even used it yourself) more times than you can count. But why?

## It’s Not Really a Lie

Let’s be clear: nobody’s trying to deceive anyone. Saying “嘘ついた” (“I lied”) is more of a humorous, self-deprecating way to own up to a mistake. It’s a linguistic quirk that lightens the mood and makes the correction feel less confrontational.

Here’s what it communicates:

Acknowledgment of Mistakes: By framing the error as a “lie,” the speaker takes full ownership of their mistake in a way that’s direct but not overly serious.

Humor and Camaraderie: The casual tone fosters a sense of teamwork and understanding. Mistakes are normalized as part of the process rather than something to be ashamed of.

Defusing Tension: Engineering can be a high-stress field. Admitting errors with a touch of humor helps keep the atmosphere relaxed and collaborative.

## Why Engineers?

This phenomenon seems particularly prevalent among engineers. Why is that?

Frequent Corrections: Engineers deal with complex systems, and it’s common to revise conclusions or update information as new data comes in. Saying “I lied” might just be an efficient way to acknowledge the fluid nature of their work.

Cultural Context: In Japan, indirect language and self-deprecation are often used to maintain harmony. Saying “I lied” might feel less confrontational than admitting, “I made a mistake.”

Shared Humor: The tech industry has its own subculture, and this phrase might be part of the camaraderie engineers build by sharing their quirks and challenges. It’s one of those called “あるある”.

## The Risks and Limits

While this habit is endearing and works well within teams of engineers, it might not translate as effectively in other contexts. For example:

Cross-Functional Communication: Non-engineers might take the phrase at face value and misinterpret it as actual dishonesty.

Professionalism: In formal or client-facing situations, this casual phrasing could come across as unprofessional or confusing.

Adapting communication to suit the audience is an essential skill, especially when working in a multinational environment like mine. “Sorry, I lied” might work in a casual team meeting, but “I’m sorry, that was incorrect” is probably a better choice for external stakeholders. Even when meeting vendors, I hear my seniors say this phrase.
