## Starting a New

Happy New Year! Wishing you all a wonderful and fulfilling year ahead.

## A Review of 2024

2024 was a significant year for me. I remember spending New Year’s Day mostly relaxing at home. Then Japan was struck by a disaster in the Noto Peninsula—a hectic way to begin the year. In April, I started working here and have been doing my best to adapt ever since.

## Some Points to Remember

Language is deeply tied to emotions. Always keep your composure when you speak. I notice my Japanese skills decline whenever my emotions become unstable.

Design your life with flexibility. Set your target.

Don't mistake your workplace or even your colleagues for home. Stay professional. Avoid overthinking or taking on responsibilities outside your scope.

Never let your environment limit your potential. If it does, consider moving on.

Go at your own pace—step by step.

Practice is the best way to learn. Let your body and mind memorize through repetition.

Keep track of important matters in notes or on a calendar. Right now, I'm using Obsidian and Capacities for my writing.

## A Wish for 2025

As 2025 starts, there's no need to stress over every detail or dwell on what others think. Keep a calm mind and let go of needless worries. Take each day as it comes, focusing on your own goals at your own pace.

Enjoy the moment—make time for yourself, stay open to learning, and appreciate each small victory. Wishing you a balanced, fulfilling journey ahead.
