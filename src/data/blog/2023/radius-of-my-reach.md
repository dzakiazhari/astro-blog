## Radius 85 cm

**Hello.**

Good morning and happy day to you. Let me welcome you to my newly established blog, _UNFOLD_. This platform shall serve as a space for my personal musings, with a touch of semi-professional flair.

## Radius 250 cm

Presently, this blog resides on a complimentary _digital press_ hosting instance, employing Ghost as its content management system (CMS), amidst the plethora of [JAMSTACK CMS](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/) available. Although as of 2024, I've moved my blog to Astro.

Initially, my intention was to create a straightforward blog with a personalized domain, a setup that could be effortlessly established. Concurrently, I contemplate utilizing Static Site Generators (SSGs) like Hugo or 11ty to fashion a static website, which can be hosted virtually at a minimal expense.

SSGs enable the creation of fully static sites without a traditional database backend, making hosting cheaper and more scalable than dynamic CMSs like WordPress. However, SSGs require more technical know-how and are less user-friendly, even more for non-developers. Alas, executing this plan at present proves to be arduous.

I'll be back soon for another post, but for now my focus needs to shift. Having just undergone surgery, I'm dedicating my energy solely to healing and recuperating.
Thank you for your understanding as I take time to prioritize my health. Wishing you all the best until then!

**Bye.**
