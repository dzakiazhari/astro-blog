# Bug Audit — 2025-02-14

## Goal
Verify whether the current codebase contains any obvious bugs or severe defects.

## Summary
- ✅ `pnpm test`
- ✅ `pnpm lint`
- ✅ `pnpm build`
- ✅ `pnpm exec prettier --check .`

All automated checks passed without errors. Manual inspection of recent bug fix history (`docs/tasks.md`) and key runtime utilities (`src/utils/getPath.ts`, `src/utils/postFilter.ts`, `public/scripts/scroll-manager.js`) did not reveal new issues. No active regressions or severe bugs were identified during this audit.

## Notes
- Keep running the full test + build suite when modifying routing, content collections, or remote font loaders—past regressions surfaced only after executing the end-to-end pipeline.
- Retain the audit log to support future health checks.
